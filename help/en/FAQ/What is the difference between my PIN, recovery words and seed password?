{:title "What is the difference between my PIN, recovery words and seed password?", :idx 6}

Your PIN prevents unauthorized users from viewing your account balances and making transactions. 

Your recovery words is an encoded version of the private key that uses ordinary English words. The recovery words MUST be kept secret: anyone who knows it can easily get your private key. 

Your seed password is an optional word attached to your recovery words. If set, you have to use recovery words together with your seed password to recover your private key. Safe keep your seed password and treat it equally important as your recovery words.
