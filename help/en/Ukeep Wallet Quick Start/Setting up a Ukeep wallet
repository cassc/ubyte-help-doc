The Ukeep wallet shipped to you does not come with any pre-installed firmware. This is to ensure the user can have the latest firmware and to avoid firmware tampering by dealers or resellers. 

Please click the *Update* button to start updating the firmware.

**Important note:**
* If you find your Ukeep walet is pre-installed with a firmware, please DO NOT use it and contact us immediately.
* Ukeep wallet may auto-disconnect and reconnect during firmware update. Please do not unplug your device before update success. 

<h3>3. Initializing the device and creating a wallet</h3>

> After installing the latest firmware,  you will initialize your Ukeep wallet by creating a new wallet. Please follow the instructions for each step carefully. Your Ukeep wallet will generate unique and random seed which can derive all your accounts and addresses.

**Hint:** If you need to restore a wallet, you should click the *Restore* button and follow the online instructions to start.

**Important note:**
* Please make sure to back up your recovery words.
* If you choose to use seed password, please make sure you also backed up it.  
* If you initialization is interrupted (either by page refresh or device disconnect), you can disconnect and re-connect your Ukeep wallet to start over.

#### 3.1 Select the number of recovery words

A larger number of recovery words provides better protection against hack by brute force. You can select between 12, 18 or 24 words. 
 

<h4>3.2 Set PIN</h4>

PIN prevents unauthorized access to your Ukeep wallet. PIN is a number with 6 to 16 digits. Please refer the keypad layout displayed on your Ukeep wallet and enter your PIN from browser. 

We recommend set a PIN with at least 6 digits and reasonably good randomness.

<h4>3.3 Set transaction password</h4>

![Payment password](/img/qs-wallet-create-paypwd-en.png)


A transaction password consists of 6 to 18 letters. If you enable the transaction password, you will be required to enter the correct transaction password before sending any coins. 


**Note:**
* If you do not enable transaction password, you still need to enter your PIN before making transactions. 
* Transaction password provides additional security for your asset, we recommend you to enable the transaction password.
 

<h4>3.4 Set the seed password </h4>

![Seed password](/img/qs-wallet-create-seedpwd-en.png)


Seed password is an additional word for your recovery words. By using a seed password, even if your  recovery words is stolen by a hacker, he/she still need your seed password to access your wallet. 

**Important note: If you choose to use a seed password, you must tread the seed password equally important as your recovery words. Without the seed password you can not restore your wallet with only your recovery words.**

> Note: When restoring your wallet, if your original wallet had a seed password, you need to enter the correct seed password to restore your wallet. If you entered an incorrect seed password, you could still restore a wallet, which is totally different from your original wallet, and very likely the wallet will be empty.


<h4>3.5 Back recovery words</h4>

After displaying the complete recovery word list, Ukeep wallet will prompt whether to display the list again.   Click the *No* button on your device if don't need to view the recovery words again. You will be required to confirm each word in your recovery word list:
