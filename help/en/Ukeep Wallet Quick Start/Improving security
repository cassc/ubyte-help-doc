<h3>Use a strong PIN</h3>

PIN is a very important protection against unauthorized access to your Ukeep wallet. You should make your PIN hard to guess, but easy for you to remember.

* Do not use overly simple codes as your PIN (eg. 1234, or 1111, etc.)
* Do not use your birthday, ID number as your PIN.
* Do not use the same passcode/PIN among multiple websites. 

 

<h3>Use a strong transaction password</h3>

Enabling a transaction password can greatly improve the safety of your crypto accounts. 

With Ukeep wallet transaction password enabled, a hacker, who had acquired your Ukeep wallet and even knew your PIN, still could not transfer asset away from your Ukeep wallet without knowing your transaction password.

We strongly encourage your to enable transaction password and make it difficult to guess.

<h3>Use a seed password</h3>

Recovery words is the key to private key recovery. If your recovery words are acquired by a hacker, he/she could derive your private key and transfer all your assets away. 

If you had enabled the seed password, in order to steal your assets, the hacker would need the seed password in addition to your recovery words. Thus we strongly recommend using a seed password which is difficult to guess and easy for you to remember.

**Warning: The seed password, if enabled, is as equally important as your recovery words. Losing either your seed password or your recovery words meas you will not be able to recover your crypto wallet.**

<h3>Safe keeping your Recovery Words</h3>

During your Ukeep wallet initialization, a list of recovery words will be generated for you. Recovery words are critical to your wallet security. You can recover your wallet using your recovery words (and your seed password if had enabled it) anytime.

**Recommendations:**

* Store your recovery words offline. 
* Do not make digital copies.
* Do not store on any websites or network connected devices.
* Consider permanent storage methods, e.g., writing down on a piece of paper and store the paper somewhere safe.
* If you have enabled the seed password, please also back up it.
